# 1.2 Security Concepts  

## CIA Triad  
- **Confidentiality** → Keep data private and accessible only to authorized users.  
  - Example: Encryption, access controls.  
- **Integrity** → Ensure data is accurate, consistent, and unaltered.  
  - Example: Hashing, checksums, digital signatures.  
- **Availability** → Ensure systems and data are accessible when needed.  
  - Example: Backups, fault tolerance, load balancing.

## Non-repudiation  
- Prevents someone from denying their actions.  
- Achieved with **digital signatures, logging, and auditing**.

## AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)  

### Authentication  
- Verifying identity.  
- **People:** Passwords, biometrics, smart cards, MFA.  
- **Systems:** Digital certificates, Kerberos tickets, SSH keys.  

### Authorization  
- Determines what resources a user/system can access after authentication.  
- **Authorization models:**  
  - **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** → Access by job role.  
  - **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)** → Access by attributes (time, location, device type).  
  - **MAC (Mandatory Access Control)** → Access controlled by classification labels.  
  - **DAC (Discretionary Access Control)** → Owner decides permissions.  

### Accounting  
- Tracking actions and usage for auditing.  
- Examples: Log files, SIEMs, monitoring.  

---

## Gap Analysis  
- Comparing **current state vs desired state** of security.  
- Identifies areas where controls/policies are missing or insufficient.  

---

## Zero Trust  

### Overview  
- “Never trust, always verify.”  
- No implicit trust; every request must be authenticated and authorized.  

### Control Plane  
- **Adaptive Identity:** Dynamic authentication (MFA, context-aware).  
- **Threat Scope Reduction:** Limit attack surface by minimizing access.  
- **Policy-Driven Access Control:** Centralized enforcement of rules.  
- **Policy Administrator:** Communicates with enforcement points.  
- **Policy Engine:** Decides access based on context and policy.  

### Data Plane  
- **Implicit Trust Zones:** Removed under Zero Trust. Every zone must validate.  
- **Subjects/Systems:** Entities requesting access (users, devices).  
- **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):** Enforces decisions made by the Policy Engine.  

---

## Physical Security Controls  

- **Bollards:** Barriers preventing vehicle access.  
- **Access Control Vestibule (Mantrap):** Double-door system controlling entry.  
- **Fencing:** Defines perimeters and restricts access.  
- **Video Surveillance (CCTV):** Monitors activity, acts as deterrent.  
- **Security Guards:** Human physical presence for detection/deterrence.  
- **Access Badges:** Electronic entry authentication.  
- **Lighting:** Deters unauthorized access at night.  
- **Sensors:**  
  - Infrared → Detects heat signatures.  
  - Pressure → Detects weight/footsteps.  
  - Microwave → Detects motion via microwave reflection.  
  - Ultrasonic → Detects movement via sound waves.

## Deception & Disruption Technology  

- **Honeypot:** Decoy system designed to lure attackers.  
- **Honeynet:** A network of honeypots.  
- **Honeyfile:** Fake file planted to detect access attempts.  
- **Honeytoken:** Fake credentials/data to detect misuse.

## Flashcards Q&A  

**Q: What are the three components of the CIA triad?**  
A: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.  

**Q: Which AAA component verifies *who* you are?**  
A: Authentication.  

**Q: What AAA model assigns access based on job function?**  
A: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).  

**Q: What does a gap analysis do?**  
A: Compares current security posture against desired/required posture to find weaknesses.  

**Q: In Zero Trust, what is the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)?**  
A: The system that enforces access decisions made by the Policy Engine.  

**Q: Name two physical security controls that act as deterrents.**  
A: Fencing, lighting (also cameras and warning signs).  

**Q: What’s the difference between a honeypot and a honeyfile?**  
A: Honeypot = decoy system, Honeyfile = decoy file.
