# 3.1 – Architecture Models

## 📚 Notes

### 🔹 Architecture & Infrastructure Concepts
- **Cloud**
  - Responsibility Matrix → Shared responsibility (provider handles infra, customer secures data/config).
  - Hybrid Considerations → Data movement, policy enforcement, integration complexity.
  - Third-party Vendors → Risk from vendor misconfigurations, SLAs, compliance.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
  - Automates infra deployment via code/templates.
  - Security = version control, secure defaults, prevent drift.
  - Risks = misconfigured templates scale instantly.

- **Serverless**
  - Functions run in provider-managed environment.
  - Benefits → scalability, less infra mgmt.
  - Risks → vendor lock-in, limited visibility.

- **Microservices**
  - App broken into small independent services.
  - Benefits → resilience, flexibility.
  - Risks → larger attack surface, API security required.

- **Network Infrastructure**
  - Design of switches, routers, firewalls.
  - Security implications = segmentation, redundancy.

- **Physical Isolation**
  - **Air-gapped** → physically disconnected from other networks.
  - High security, but harder to update/maintain.

- **Logical Segmentation**
  - VLANs, subnetting, firewall rules.
  - Easier to isolate traffic without extra hardware.

- **Software-defined Networking (SDN)**
  - Control plane separated from data plane.
  - Centralized policy, agile changes.
  - Risks = single point of failure if controller is compromised.

- **On-premises**
  - Org controls hardware/software in own datacenter.
  - High control, but high cost and responsibility.

- **Centralized vs. Decentralized**
  - Centralized → single mgmt point, efficiency, but bigger blast radius.
  - Decentralized → resilience, less efficient, harder mgmt.

- **Containerization**
  - Lightweight, isolated environments (Docker).
  - Security = image scanning, isolation, orchestrator security (K8s).

- **Virtualization**
  - Multiple OS on single hardware (VMware, Hyper-V).
  - Risks → hypervisor compromise, VM escape.

- **IoT**
  - Smart devices (sensors, cameras, etc.).
  - Risks → weak defaults, lack of patching, lateral movement.

- **ICS / SCADA**
  - Industrial control and supervisory systems.
  - Often run legacy/real-time systems, availability > confidentiality.
  - Security = isolation, patch mgmt, monitoring.

- **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**
  - Used in embedded/critical systems requiring predictable timing.
  - Security patching is difficult due to uptime needs.

- **Embedded Systems**
  - Single-purpose hardware/software combos (routers, medical devices).
  - Often unpatchable → long-term vulnerabilities.

- **High Availability**
  - Systems designed for minimal downtime (redundancy, failover clusters).
  - Security = ensure failover isn’t bypassed.

### 🔹 Considerations
- **Availability** → Can system stay online?
- **Resilience** → Ability to withstand attacks/failures.
- **Cost** → Cloud vs on-prem trade-offs.
- **Responsiveness** → Latency, quick changes.
- **Scalability** → Growth potential, elastic scaling.
- **Ease of Deployment** → IaC and automation speed things up.
- **Risk Transference** → Using vendors shifts some (not all) risk.
- **Ease of Recovery** → Snapshots, backups, tested DR plans.
- **Patch Availability** → Can vendor/system be patched easily?
- **Inability to Patch** → IoT/embedded often unpatchable → isolate/mitigate.
- **Power & Compute** → Resource planning; shortages = downtime.

## 📚 Key Takeaways
- Different models balance **control, cost, scalability, and risk**.  
- Cloud & IaC improve agility but risk misconfigurations.  
- Legacy systems (ICS, IoT, embedded) introduce patching challenges.  
- Segmentation (physical/logical) is core to reducing blast radius.  
- Availability, resilience, and recovery planning must be weighed with cost.

## 🎴 Flashcards

**Q:** In cloud computing, what does the responsibility matrix outline?  
**A:** Which security tasks are handled by the provider vs. the customer (shared responsibility model).

---

**Q:** What’s a main hybrid cloud security consideration?  
**A:** Ensuring consistent policies and secure data movement between environments.

---

**Q:** What’s a key risk with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?  
**A:** Misconfigured templates can scale insecure environments instantly.

---

**Q:** How is serverless computing different from traditional models?  
**A:** Code runs in provider-managed environments with no server mgmt by the customer.

---

**Q:** What is the main security risk of microservices architecture?  
**A:** Larger attack surface via APIs — each service must be secured individually.

---

**Q:** What’s the difference between physical isolation and logical segmentation?  
**A:** Physical isolation (air-gapped) = no connection; logical segmentation = VLANs/subnets to separate traffic virtually.

---

**Q:** What is a major risk of software-defined networking (SDN)?  
**A:** Compromise of the centralized controller can affect the entire network.

---

**Q:** What’s a hypervisor escape?  
**A:** An exploit that lets a VM break out and access the host or other VMs.

---

**Q:** Why are IoT and embedded systems challenging for security?  
**A:** They often lack patching capabilities or have weak default configs.

---

**Q:** Why is availability critical in ICS/SCADA environments?  
**A:** Outages can disrupt industrial operations, so uptime is prioritized over confidentiality.

---

**Q:** What is a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) used for?  
**A:** Embedded/critical systems requiring predictable, time-sensitive operations.

---

**Q:** What does “risk transference” mean in architecture decisions?  
**A:** Shifting some risk to vendors/third parties (e.g., cloud providers, insurers).

---

**Q:** What does “high availability” architecture aim to achieve?  
**A:** Minimal downtime using redundancy and failover systems.

---

**Q:** What’s a security issue with systems that cannot be patched?  
**A:** They remain vulnerable long-term and require isolation or compensating controls.
