# 5.2 – Risk Management

### Risk Identification
- Process of discovering potential risks to assets, operations, or data.
- Sources: threat modeling, vulnerability scans, compliance reviews, audits, incident history.

### Risk Assessment
- Determines severity and likelihood of risks.
- **Types:**
  - **Ad hoc:** Performed in response to an event.
  - **Recurring:** Scheduled periodically (monthly, quarterly).
  - **One-time:** Conducted for a project or new system.
  - **Continuous:** Ongoing monitoring with automation.

### Risk Analysis
- **Qualitative:** Uses descriptive scales (high/medium/low).
- **Quantitative:** Uses numerical values (costs, probabilities).
- **Key metrics:**
  - **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy):** Asset Value × Exposure Factor.
  - **ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence):** Expected frequency per year.
  - **ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy):** SLE × ARO.
- **Probability/Likelihood:** Chance of risk occurring.
- **Asset Value (AV):** The monetary worth of an asset, used as a baseline for calculating potential losses.
- **Exposure Factor (EF):** % of asset value lost in an incident.
- **Impact:** Overall damage (financial, reputational, operational).

### Risk Register
- Centralized document tracking identified risks.
- Contains:
  - **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs):** Metrics/signals showing risk is rising.
  - **Risk Owners:** Individuals responsible for monitoring/managing risk.
  - **Risk Threshold:** Maximum acceptable risk level before action required.

### Risk Tolerance
- Degree of variability an organization is willing to withstand in pursuit of objectives.

### Risk Appetite
- Overall stance toward risk.
  - **Expansionary:** Willing to take higher risk for growth.
  - **Conservative:** Prefers safety and stability, avoids high risk.
  - **Neutral:** Balanced between growth and caution.

### Risk Management Strategies
- **Transfer:** Shift risk to another party (insurance, outsourcing).
- **Accept:** Acknowledge and live with the risk.
  - **Exemption:** Formal documented acceptance (often regulatory).
  - **Exception:** Temporary allowance outside policy.
- **Avoid:** Eliminate the risk entirely (discontinue risky activity).
- **Mitigate:** Implement controls to reduce likelihood/impact.

### Risk Reporting
- Communicating risk status to stakeholders (boards, regulators, management).
- Ensures transparency and accountability.

### Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Identifies critical business functions and recovery priorities.
- **Metrics:**
  - **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Maximum downtime before critical impact.
  - **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Maximum tolerable data loss (measured in time).
  - **MTTR (Mean Time to Repair):** Average time to fix a failed component.
  - **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures):** Average operational time between breakdowns.

## Flashcards

**Q: What is risk identification?**  
A: The process of discovering potential risks to assets, operations, or data.

**Q: What are the four types of risk assessments?**  
A: Ad hoc, Recurring, One-time, Continuous.

**Q: What is qualitative risk analysis?**  
A: Assigning risk levels using descriptive scales (e.g., high, medium, low).

**Q: What is quantitative risk analysis?**  
A: Using numerical measures (probability, costs) to calculate risk impact.

**Q: Define SLE.**  
A: Single Loss Expectancy = Asset Value × Exposure Factor.

**Q: Define ARO.**  
A: Annualized Rate of Occurrence = Expected frequency of an event per year.

**Q: Define ALE.**  
A: Annualized Loss Expectancy = SLE × ARO.

**Q: What is exposure factor (EF)?**  
A: Percentage of asset value lost during an incident.

**Q: What is a risk register used for?**  
A: Tracking and documenting risks, owners, thresholds, and KRIs.

**Q: What are key risk indicators (KRIs)?**  
A: Metrics/signals showing a rising risk level.

**Q: Who are risk owners?**  
A: Individuals responsible for monitoring/managing a specific risk.

**Q: What is risk tolerance?**  
A: The degree of variability an organization can withstand.

**Q: What are the three stances of risk appetite?**  
A: Expansionary, Conservative, Neutral.

**Q: What are the four main risk management strategies?**  
A: Transfer, Accept, Avoid, Mitigate.

**Q: What is the difference between exemption and exception in risk acceptance?**  
A: Exemption = formal documented acceptance; Exception = temporary allowance.

**Q: What is risk reporting?**  
A: Communicating risk status to stakeholders.

**Q: What is RTO?**  
A: Recovery Time Objective = Maximum acceptable downtime.

**Q: What is RPO?**  
A: Recovery Point Objective = Maximum tolerable data loss.

**Q: What is MTTR?**  
A: Mean Time to Repair = Average time to fix a failure.

**Q: What is MTBF?**  
A: Mean Time Between Failures = Average uptime between failures.
