# 4.5 – Enterprise Security (Security+ SY0-701)

## Firewall
- **Rules**: Define what traffic is allowed/denied.
- **Access lists (ACLs)**: Specify users, IPs, or networks permitted or denied access.
- **Ports/protocols**: Control traffic by TCP/UDP port or protocol type (e.g., block Telnet, allow SSH).
- **Screened subnets (DMZ)**: Isolate public-facing servers from internal network; traffic tightly controlled between zones.

---

## IDS/IPS
- **Trends**: Detect anomalous activity or traffic spikes.
- **Signatures**: Match traffic against known malicious patterns.  
  - IDS (Intrusion Detection System): Alerts when patterns are seen.  
  - IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): Actively blocks traffic.

---

## Web Filter
- **Agent-based**: Installed on endpoints to enforce policies outside the corporate network.
- **Centralized proxy**: Routes traffic through a proxy for filtering/inspection.
- **URL scanning**: Checks requests against blacklists/whitelists of sites.
- **Content categorization**: Filters based on site type (e.g., gambling, adult, social media).
- **Block rules**: Define what categories or sites are restricted.
- **Reputation**: Uses real-time reputation scores to block risky domains.

---

## Operating System Security
- **Group Policy (Windows)**: Centralized management of OS security settings (password rules, software restrictions).
- **SELinux (Linux)**: Mandatory access control (MAC) framework; enforces strict process permissions.

---

## Implementation of Secure Protocols
- **Protocol selection**: Use secure versions (e.g., SSH instead of Telnet, HTTPS instead of HTTP).
- **Port selection**: Ensure traffic runs on standard/approved ports (443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH).
- **Transport method**: Enforce encryption in transit (TLS, IPsec, VPN tunnels).

---

## DNS Filtering
- Blocks access to malicious or unauthorized domains.
- Uses reputation lists and custom allow/deny lists.
- Can redirect requests to sinkholes or block pages.

---

## Email Security
- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**: Prevents spoofing by validating sending server IPs.
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**: Cryptographic signatures verify email integrity.
- **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)**: Aligns SPF + DKIM, provides reporting on spoofing attempts.
- **Gateway**: Scans email for spam, malware, phishing before delivery.

---

## File Integrity Monitoring
- Detects unauthorized changes to files, directories, or registries.
- Used for compliance and security monitoring.

---

## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Prevents sensitive data from leaving the network.
- Can monitor endpoints, networks, cloud services.
- Blocks copy, upload, email, or printing of restricted data.

---

## Network Access Control (NAC)
- Enforces device health and compliance before granting access.
- Can block/quarantine unpatched or noncompliant devices.
- Supports 802.1X authentication for secure port-based access.

---

## Endpoint & Extended Detection and Response
- **EDR**: Endpoint-focused; detects, investigates, responds to suspicious activity.
- **XDR**: Extends beyond endpoints → integrates data from endpoints, network, cloud, and email for broader correlation and response.

---

## User Behavior Analytics (UBA)
- Monitors normal user activity to establish baselines.
- Detects anomalies (e.g., unusual logins, data access, file transfers).
- Helps identify insider threats and compromised accounts.

# Flashcards (Q&A)

**Q: What do firewall rules define?**  
A: What traffic is allowed or denied.  

**Q: What is the purpose of an access control list (ACL) on a firewall?**  
A: To permit or deny traffic based on user, IP, or network.  

**Q: How do firewalls use ports and protocols for filtering?**  
A: By allowing or blocking specific TCP/UDP ports and protocol types.  

**Q: What is a screened subnet (DMZ)?**  
A: An isolated subnet for public-facing servers, separated from internal systems.  

**Q: What’s the difference between IDS and IPS?**  
A: IDS alerts on malicious traffic, IPS actively blocks it.  

**Q: What are signatures in IDS/IPS?**  
A: Known malicious patterns used for detection.  

**Q: What is an agent-based web filter?**  
A: Filtering software installed directly on endpoints.  

**Q: What is a centralized proxy web filter?**  
A: Routes all traffic through a proxy server for filtering.  

**Q: What does URL scanning do in web filtering?**  
A: Checks site requests against blacklists/whitelists.  

**Q: What is content categorization in web filters?**  
A: Filtering based on type of site (e.g., gambling, adult).  

**Q: What are block rules in web filters?**  
A: Rules that restrict access to certain sites or categories.  

**Q: What is reputation-based filtering?**  
A: Blocking sites/domains based on real-time trust scores.  

**Q: What is Group Policy in Windows security?**  
A: Centralized management of OS security settings.  

**Q: What is SELinux used for?**  
A: Enforcing strict mandatory access control on Linux systems.  

**Q: Give examples of secure protocol selection.**  
A: SSH instead of Telnet, HTTPS instead of HTTP.  

**Q: Why is port selection important in secure protocol use?**  
A: Ensures traffic uses approved/standard ports.  

**Q: What is the role of transport methods like TLS or IPsec?**  
A: To encrypt traffic in transit.  

**Q: What does DNS filtering do?**  
A: Blocks access to malicious or unauthorized domains.  

**Q: What does SPF prevent in email security?**  
A: Spoofing by validating sending server IPs.  

**Q: What does DKIM provide for email?**  
A: Integrity and authenticity through cryptographic signatures.  

**Q: What does DMARC do?**  
A: Aligns SPF and DKIM, and provides reporting.  

**Q: What is an email gateway’s function?**  
A: To filter spam, phishing, and malware before delivery.  

**Q: What does file integrity monitoring do?**  
A: Detects unauthorized changes to critical files.  

**Q: What is the goal of Data Loss Prevention (DLP)?**  
A: To prevent sensitive data from leaving the network.  

**Q: What does Network Access Control (NAC) enforce?**  
A: Device compliance before granting network access.  

**Q: What is the difference between EDR and XDR?**  
A: EDR focuses on endpoints; XDR integrates endpoints with network, cloud, and email data.  

**Q: What does User Behavior Analytics (UBA) do?**  
A: Detects anomalies by monitoring deviations from normal user activity.
