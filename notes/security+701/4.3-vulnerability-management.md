# 4.3 – Vulnerability Management

## Identification Methods
- **Vulnerability scan**
  - Automated tool to identify known flaws in systems.
  - Can be credentialed (authenticated) or non-credentialed.

- **Application security**
  - **Static analysis**: Examine source code for vulnerabilities without running it.
  - **Dynamic analysis**: Test application while it’s running; looks for runtime issues like input handling or memory leaks.
  - **Package monitoring**: Tracks third-party libraries/dependencies for known CVEs.

- **Threat feed**
  - **OSINT (Open-source intelligence)**: Publicly available sources (blogs, GitHub, advisories).
  - **Proprietary/third-party**: Paid feeds with curated intel.
  - **Information-sharing organizations**: ISACs/ISAOs, government partnerships.
  - **Dark web**: Monitor underground forums/marketplaces for leaked data or exploits.

- **Penetration testing**
  - Active exploitation of vulnerabilities to test real-world impact.

- **Responsible disclosure program**
  - Structured way for researchers to report vulnerabilities.
  - **Bug bounty program**: Pays external researchers for responsibly reporting bugs.

- **System/process audit**
  - Independent review of processes, configs, and systems for vulnerabilities.

## Analysis
- **Confirmation**
  - **False positive**: Tool reports a vulnerability that isn’t real.
  - **False negative**: Tool misses a vulnerability that is real.

- **Prioritize**
  - Rank vulnerabilities by severity, exploitability, and business impact.

- **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**
  - Standardized score (0–10) that measures severity of a vulnerability.

- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**
  - Public identifier for a known vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability classification**
  - Categorize (e.g., SQL injection, buffer overflow, privilege escalation).

- **Exposure factor**
  - Estimate of potential damage if a vulnerability is exploited.

- **Environmental variables**
  - Local factors (system role, network placement, data sensitivity).

- **Industry/organizational impact**
  - Sector-specific risk (healthcare, finance, etc.).

- **Risk tolerance**
  - Each org’s threshold for acceptable risk before acting.

## Vulnerability Response and Remediation
- **Patching**
  - Apply vendor updates to remove vulnerability.

- **Insurance**
  - Transfer some financial risk through cyber insurance.

- **Segmentation**
  - Limit the spread of an exploit by isolating vulnerable systems.

- **Compensating controls**
  - Security measures that offset risk when a fix isn’t possible.

- **Exceptions and exemptions**
  - Formal approval to not remediate a vulnerability (temporarily or permanently).

---

## Validation of Remediation
- **Rescanning**
  - Run vulnerability scans again to confirm fixes.

- **Audit**
  - Independent review of remediation steps.

- **Verification**
  - Confirm patches/controls are working as intended.

---

## Reporting
- Document vulnerabilities, analysis, remediation steps, and validation.
- Share with stakeholders for compliance, accountability, and ongoing risk management.
