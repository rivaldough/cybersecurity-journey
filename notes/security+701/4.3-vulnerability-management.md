# 4.3 – Vulnerability Management

## Identification Methods
- **Vulnerability scan**
  - Automated tool to identify known flaws in systems.
  - Can be credentialed (authenticated) or non-credentialed.

- **Application security**
  - **Static analysis**: Examine source code for vulnerabilities without running it.
  - **Dynamic analysis**: Test application while it’s running; looks for runtime issues like input handling or memory leaks.
  - **Package monitoring**: Tracks third-party libraries/dependencies for known CVEs.

- **Threat feed**
  - **OSINT (Open-source intelligence)**: Publicly available sources (blogs, GitHub, advisories).
  - **Proprietary/third-party**: Paid feeds with curated intel.
  - **Information-sharing organizations**: ISACs/ISAOs, government partnerships.
  - **Dark web**: Monitor underground forums/marketplaces for leaked data or exploits.

- **Penetration testing**
  - Active exploitation of vulnerabilities to test real-world impact.

- **Responsible disclosure program**
  - Structured way for researchers to report vulnerabilities.
  - **Bug bounty program**: Pays external researchers for responsibly reporting bugs.

- **System/process audit**
  - Independent review of processes, configs, and systems for vulnerabilities.

## Analysis
- **Confirmation**
  - **False positive**: Tool reports a vulnerability that isn’t real.
  - **False negative**: Tool misses a vulnerability that is real.

- **Prioritize**
  - Rank vulnerabilities by severity, exploitability, and business impact.

- **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**
  - Standardized score (0–10) that measures severity of a vulnerability.

- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**
  - Public identifier for a known vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability classification**
  - Categorize (e.g., SQL injection, buffer overflow, privilege escalation).

- **Exposure factor**
  - Estimate of potential damage if a vulnerability is exploited.

### Environmental Variables
- Local factors that influence the risk and prioritization of a vulnerability.  
  - **Environment type**: Internal server, public cloud, test lab.  
  - **Prioritization/patching frequency**:  
    - Database server vs. isolated test
    - Number and type of users (internal vs. external).  
    - Revenue-generating or mission-critical.  
    - Potential for exploit

- **Industry/organizational impact**
  - Sector-specific risk (healthcare, finance, etc.).

- **Risk tolerance**
  - Each org’s threshold for acceptable risk before acting.

---

## Vulnerability Response and Remediation
- **Patching**
  - Apply vendor updates to remove vulnerability.

- **Insurance**
  - Transfer some financial risk through cyber insurance.

- **Segmentation**
  - Limit the spread of an exploit by isolating vulnerable systems.

- **Compensating controls**
  - Security measures that offset risk when a fix isn’t possible.

- **Exceptions and exemptions**
  - Formal approval to not remediate a vulnerability (temporarily or permanently).

---

## Validation of Remediation
- **Rescanning**
  - Run vulnerability scans again to confirm fixes.

- **Audit**
  - Independent review of remediation steps.

- **Verification**
  - Confirm patches/controls are working as intended.

---

## Reporting
- Document vulnerabilities, analysis, remediation steps, and validation.
- Share with stakeholders for compliance, accountability, and ongoing risk management.

# Flashcards (Q&A)

**Q: What is the purpose of a vulnerability scan?**  
A: To automatically identify known flaws in systems (credentialed or non-credentialed).  

**Q: What is static analysis in application security?**  
A: Reviewing source code for vulnerabilities without executing it.  

**Q: What is dynamic analysis in application security?**  
A: Testing an application while running to identify runtime issues.  

**Q: What is package monitoring used for?**  
A: To track vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.  

**Q: What are the four types of threat feeds?**  
A: OSINT, proprietary/third-party, information-sharing organizations, dark web.  

**Q: What is the purpose of penetration testing?**  
A: To actively exploit vulnerabilities and test real-world impact.  

**Q: What is a responsible disclosure program?**  
A: A structured way for researchers to report vulnerabilities safely.  

**Q: What is a bug bounty program?**  
A: A program that rewards external researchers for responsibly reporting bugs.  

**Q: What is a system or process audit in vulnerability management?**  
A: An independent review of processes, configs, and systems for vulnerabilities.  

**Q: What is a false positive in vulnerability scanning?**  
A: When a scan flags a vulnerability that doesn’t actually exist.  

**Q: What is a false negative in vulnerability scanning?**  
A: When a scan misses a vulnerability that is actually present.  

**Q: What is CVSS?**  
A: Common Vulnerability Scoring System — a standardized 0–10 severity score.  

**Q: What is CVE?**  
A: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures — a unique ID for a known vulnerability.  

**Q: What does vulnerability classification mean?**  
A: Grouping vulnerabilities by type (e.g., SQL injection, buffer overflow).  

**Q: What is exposure factor?**  
A: The estimated level of potential damage if a vulnerability is exploited.  

**Q: What are environmental variables in vulnerability analysis?**  
A: Local factors like system role, network placement, and data sensitivity.  

**Q: What is risk tolerance in vulnerability management?**  
A: The level of risk an organization is willing to accept before taking action.  

**Q: What is patching in remediation?**  
A: Applying vendor updates to remove vulnerabilities.  

**Q: What role does insurance play in vulnerability management?**  
A: Transfers financial risk associated with vulnerabilities.  

**Q: What is segmentation in vulnerability response?**  
A: Isolating vulnerable systems to prevent exploit spread.  

**Q: What are compensating controls?**  
A: Alternative security measures used when a fix isn’t possible.  

**Q: What are exceptions and exemptions?**  
A: Formal approvals to not remediate a vulnerability, temporarily or permanently.
