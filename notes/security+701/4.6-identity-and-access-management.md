# 4.6 – Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### Provisioning & De-Provisioning
- **Provisioning**: Creating accounts, assigning roles/permissions when a user joins.  
- **De-provisioning**: Disabling/removing accounts immediately when a user leaves.  
- Automating with **Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML)** processes reduces insider threat risk.  

### Permission Assignments & Implications
- **Over-privileged accounts** increase attack surface.  
- Must follow **least privilege** → only grant what’s needed.  
- Regular **access reviews/attestation** prevent privilege creep.  

### Identity Proofing
- Verifying user identity at onboarding (e.g., government ID, biometrics).  
- Ensures the account really belongs to the right person.  

### Federation
- Trust relationship between different identity systems.  
- Example: Logging into a partner’s portal using your corporate credentials.  

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
- One login grants access to multiple systems.  
- **LDAP**: Directory-based authentication (e.g., AD).  
- **OAuth**: Authorization framework (“Login with Google”).  
- **SAML**: XML-based authentication/authorization exchange.  

### Interoperability
- IAM systems working across different platforms/organizations.  
- Important in mergers, acquisitions, hybrid cloud.  

### Attestation
- Formal verification of user access rights by managers.  
- Ensures privileges are valid and still needed.  

### Access Controls
- **Mandatory (MAC):** System-enforced labels/classifications.  
- **Discretionary (DAC):** Owners decide access.  
- **Role-based (RBAC):** Access tied to roles.  
- **Rule-based:** System-enforced conditions (firewalls, schedules).  
- **Attribute-based (ABAC):** Decisions based on attributes (dept, location, time).  
- **Time-of-day restrictions:** Limit access to certain hours.  
- **Least privilege:** Minimal rights granted.  

### Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
- **Implementations**: Biometrics, hard tokens, soft tokens, security keys.  
- **Factors**:  
  - Something you know (password, PIN).  
  - Something you have (token, phone, card).  
  - Something you are (biometrics).  
  - Somewhere you are (location/IP).  

### Password Concepts
- **Best Practices**: 12–16+ chars, complexity, no reuse, rotate only when breached, set min age.  
- **Password Managers**: Store/manage unique strong passwords.  
- **Passwordless**: Biometrics, FIDO keys, magic links.  

### Privileged Access Management (PAM) Tools
- **Just-in-time permissions**: Temporary elevated rights.  
- **Password vaulting**: Store and rotate admin passwords.  
- **Ephemeral credentials**: Short-lived tokens (e.g., AWS STS).

## Flashcards

**Q: What is provisioning in IAM?**  
A: Creating accounts and assigning roles/permissions when a user joins.

**Q: What is de-provisioning?**  
A: Disabling or removing accounts when a user leaves, to prevent orphaned accounts.

**Q: Why is least privilege important?**  
A: Reduces attack surface by granting only the access a user needs.

**Q: What is identity proofing?**  
A: Verifying a person’s identity during onboarding (e.g., ID, biometrics).

**Q: What is federation?**  
A: A trust relationship that allows credentials from one system to access another.

**Q: What does SSO provide?**  
A: One login gives access to multiple systems.

**Q: Which protocols support SSO?**  
A: LDAP, OAuth, and SAML.

**Q: What is interoperability in IAM?**  
A: The ability for IAM systems across organizations/platforms to work together.

**Q: What is attestation in IAM?**  
A: Managers verifying that user privileges are correct and still required.

**Q: What is MAC?**  
A: Mandatory Access Control — system-enforced labels/classifications determine access.

**Q: What is DAC?**  
A: Discretionary Access Control — resource owners decide access.

**Q: What is RBAC?**  
A: Role-Based Access Control — access tied to roles like HR, Finance, IT.

**Q: What is ABAC?**  
A: Attribute-Based Access Control — decisions based on attributes (dept, location, time).

**Q: What is rule-based access control?**  
A: Access granted/denied based on system rules (ACLs, firewall rules, schedules).

**Q: What are common MFA factors?**  
A: Something you know, have, are, or somewhere you are.

**Q: Give examples of MFA implementations.**  
A: Biometrics, tokens, authenticator apps, security keys.

**Q: What are password best practices?**  
A: Strong length, complexity, no reuse, rotate if breached, enforce minimum age.

**Q: What is a password manager used for?**  
A: Securely storing and managing unique strong passwords.

**Q: What is passwordless authentication?**  
A: Using biometrics, security keys, or magic links instead of a password.

**Q: What is just-in-time access in PAM?**  
A: Granting temporary admin rights only when needed.

**Q: What is password vaulting in PAM?**  
A: Storing and rotating privileged credentials securely.

**Q: What are ephemeral credentials?**  
A: Short-lived tokens that expire automatically (e.g., AWS STS).
