# **Section 3.2: Applying Security Principles**  

**Objective:** Given a scenario, apply security principles to secure enterprise infrastructure.  

---

## Infrastructure Considerations  

### Device Placement  
- Firewalls typically go at the perimeter, IDS sensors behind them, jump servers in DMZ.  
- Goal: reduce attack surface and limit exposure.  

### Security Zones  
- Perimeter / public-facing zone: Public-facing systems (web servers, email gateways).  
- Internal network: Workstations, servers.  
- Restricted zone: Critical assets (databases, domain controllers).  
- Principle: the deeper in, the more protected.  

### Attack Surface  
- Every open port, service, or connection is an entry point.  
- Reduce attack surface by patching, closing unused ports, and limiting services.  

### Connectivity  
- Direct vs. segmented communication.  
- Use segmentation/VLANs to avoid flat networks.  

### Failure Modes  
- Fail-open: Traffic flows if device fails. More available, less secure.  
- Fail-closed: Traffic blocked if device fails. More secure, less available.  
- Choice depends on context (e.g., hospital networks may prefer fail-open).  

### Device Attributes  
- Active vs. Passive:  
  - Active = interacts with traffic (IPS, firewall).  
  - Passive = only observes (IDS, sensors).  
- Inline vs. Tap/Monitor:  
  - Inline = sits in the traffic path, can block.  
  - Tap/Monitor = copies traffic, cannot block.

## Network Appliances  

- Jump Server: Hardened system to manage devices in a restricted zone.  
- Proxy Server: Mediates user traffic, hides IP, enforces policies.  
- IDS/IPS: IDS detects and alerts, IPS blocks malicious traffic.  
- Load Balancer: Splits traffic across servers, can offload SSL.  
- Sensors: Passive devices that capture traffic for SIEM or analysis.  

---

## Port Security  

- 802.1X: Port-based network access control. Device must authenticate (often with RADIUS).  
- EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol): Flexible authentication used in Wi-Fi and VPNs (EAP-TLS, PEAP, etc.).  

---

## Firewall Types  

- Web Application Firewall (WAF): Protects web applications (SQLi, XSS).  
- Unified Threat Management (UTM): All-in-one device (firewall + AV + VPN + IPS).  
- Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW): Deep packet inspection, identity-aware policies.  
- Layer 4 vs. Layer 7:  
  - L4 = transport layer (IP, port, protocol).  
  - L7 = application layer (can inspect HTTP requests, app-specific traffic).  

---

## Secure Communication and Access  

- VPN: Encrypted tunnel into a private network.  
- Remote Access: Secure connections for off-site users.  
- Tunneling: Encapsulating traffic in secure protocols.  
  - TLS: Used in HTTPS, point-to-point encryption.  
  - IPSec: Used for VPNs; AH for integrity, ESP for encryption.  
- SD-WAN: Software-defined WAN, cloud-managed, improves routing and visibility.  
- SASE (Secure Access Service Edge): Combines SD-WAN with cloud-based security services (CASB, ZTNA, FWaaS).  

---

## Selection of Effective Controls  

- Match controls to risks:  
  - IDS/IPS = detect/block malicious traffic.  
  - Firewalls = enforce segmentation and policy.  
  - VPN/IPSec = secure remote access.  
  - WAF = protect web-facing apps.  
- Key principles:  
  - Defense-in-depth.  
  - Least privilege.  
  - Fail-safe defaults.  
  - Continuous monitoring.

# Flashcards â€“ Section 3.2  

**Q: What is the purpose of a Perimeter / public-facing zone?**  
A: To host public-facing systems (web/email servers) while isolating them from the internal network.  

**Q: What is the difference between fail-open and fail-closed?**  
A: Fail-open allows traffic if the device fails (less secure, more available). Fail-closed blocks traffic if it fails (more secure, less available).  

**Q: What is the difference between active vs passive devices?**  
A: Active devices interact with traffic (IPS, firewall). Passive devices only observe (IDS, sensors).  

**Q: Inline vs Tap/Monitor?**  
A: Inline devices sit in the traffic path and can block. Tap/Monitor devices observe a copy of traffic and cannot block.  

**Q: Jump server vs proxy server?**  
A: Jump server is used to securely manage devices in a restricted zone. Proxy server filters/mediates user traffic and hides client IPs.  

**Q: IDS vs IPS?**  
A: IDS = detects and alerts. IPS = actively blocks traffic.  

**Q: What does 802.1X provide?**  
A: Port-based network access control; requires device authentication.  

**Q: What is EAP used for?**  
A: Flexible authentication in wireless networks and VPNs.  

**Q: What does a WAF protect against?**  
A: Web application attacks like SQL injection and XSS.  

**Q: What is the difference between NGFW and traditional firewalls?**  
A: NGFW inspects traffic deeply (Layer 7), applies identity-based policies, and detects advanced threats.  

**Q: TLS vs IPSec?**  
A: TLS = point-to-point encryption (HTTPS). IPSec = VPN tunnels; AH for integrity, ESP for encryption.  

**Q: What is SD-WAN?**  
A: Software-defined WAN with centralized cloud management for routing and security.  

**Q: What is SASE?**  
A: Secure Access Service Edge; combines SD-WAN with cloud-delivered security (CASB, ZTNA, FWaaS).  

**Q: What are key principles for effective security controls?**  
A: Defense-in-depth, least privilege, fail-safe defaults, continuous monitoring.
