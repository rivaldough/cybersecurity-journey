# 3.4 – Resiliency and Recovery

## Importance
- **Resilience** = ability to *resist disruption* and continue operations.  
- **Recovery** = ability to *restore services* quickly after a disruption.  
- Both ensure the **CIA triad** (confidentiality, integrity, availability).

## High Availability
- **Load Balancing**
  - Distributes traffic across multiple servers.
  - Improves performance + uptime.
  - May require session persistence.
- **Clustering**
  - Multiple systems act as one.
  - Fault tolerance — failover is seamless.

## Site Considerations
- **Hot site** → Fully operational, real-time replication, immediate failover.  
- **Warm site** → Equipped with some hardware/software, needs setup.  
- **Cold site** → Facility only, no hardware; slowest recovery.  
- **Geographic dispersion** → Sites spread across regions to avoid single-point disaster.

## Platform Diversity
- Avoid monocultures (all Windows, all Cisco, etc.).
- Different OSes/vendors reduce risk of a single exploit affecting everything.

## Multi-Cloud Systems
- Use multiple cloud providers.
- Prevents vendor lock-in, adds redundancy.
- Complexity increases management/security overhead.

## Continuity of Operations
- Plans to ensure essential business functions continue during disruption.
- Covers **people, processes, technology**.

## Capacity Planning
- **People** → Enough skilled staff.  
- **Technology** → Compute, storage, bandwidth for growth + failover.  
- **Infrastructure** → Power, cooling, facilities for peak + emergencies.  

## Testing
- **Tabletop exercises** → Scenario walk-throughs.  
- **Failover testing** → Switch to backup site/systems.  
- **Simulation** → Controlled “real-world” test.  
- **Parallel processing** → Run recovery alongside production.  

## Backups
- **Onsite vs. Offsite** → Local = fast, offsite = disaster resilience.  
- **Frequency** → Full / Differential / Incremental.  
- **Encryption** → Protect backups at rest + in transit.  
- **Snapshots** → Point-in-time VM/data copies.  
- **Recovery** → Must test restoration regularly.  
- **Replication** → Continuous/scheduled data copy.  
- **Journaling** → Fine-grained transaction logging for rollback.  

## Power
- **Generators** → Long-term backup (diesel/natural gas).  
- **UPS** → Short-term battery power until generator or shutdown.  

# Flashcards (Q&A)

**Q: What’s the difference between resilience and recovery?**  
A: Resilience = resist disruption and keep operating; Recovery = restore services after a disruption.  

**Q: Load balancing vs. clustering?**  
A: Load balancing spreads traffic across multiple servers; clustering makes multiple systems act as one for fault tolerance.  

**Q: Hot site vs. warm site vs. cold site?**  
A: Hot = fully ready, immediate failover; Warm = partially equipped, some setup; Cold = empty facility, slowest recovery.  

**Q: Why is geographic dispersion important?**  
A: Prevents a single disaster (natural or man-made) from affecting all systems.  

**Q: What is platform diversity?**  
A: Using different OSes/vendors to reduce risk of one vulnerability affecting all systems.  

**Q: Why use multi-cloud systems?**  
A: To avoid vendor lock-in, add redundancy, and improve resilience.  

**Q: What does continuity of operations ensure?**  
A: Essential business functions continue during/after disruption.  

**Q: Capacity planning includes which three areas?**  
A: People, Technology, Infrastructure.  

**Q: What are tabletop exercises?**  
A: Discussion-based scenario walk-throughs for training and planning.  

**Q: What’s parallel processing in recovery testing?**  
A: Running recovery systems alongside production to verify functionality.  

**Q: Onsite vs. offsite backups?**  
A: Onsite = fast, but vulnerable to local disasters; Offsite = safer from local risks, slower to restore.  

**Q: Why encrypt backups?**  
A: Protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.  

**Q: What is journaling in backups?**  
A: Logging every transaction/change to allow fine-grained recovery.  

**Q: Generator vs. UPS?**  
A: Generator = long-term backup power; UPS = short-term battery to bridge the gap or allow safe shutdown.
