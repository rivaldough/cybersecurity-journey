# 1.3 Change Management  

## Why Change Management Matters  
- Ensures changes are **planned, tested, reviewed, and documented**.  
- Prevents downtime, security gaps, and compliance failures.  
- Provides accountability through approvals and records.  

---

## Business Processes Impacting Security Operations  

- **Approval Process** → Formal authorization before a change is made. Prevents unauthorized/rogue changes.  
- **Ownership** → Defines who is responsible for the change and its outcomes.  
- **Stakeholders** → Identifies everyone affected by the change (users, admins, management).  
- **Impact Analysis** → Assesses risks/benefits before change (security, downtime, cost).  
- **Test Results** → Proof that change was validated in a safe environment.  
- **Backout Plan** → Steps to revert if the change causes issues.  
- **Maintenance Window** → Scheduled time for changes to minimize disruption.  
- **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** → Consistent documented process to follow during changes.

## Technical Implications of Change  

- **Allow Lists / Deny Lists** → Modifying permissions for apps, services, IPs.  
- **Restricted Activities** → Defining what processes/apps should not run.  
- **Downtime** → Planned or unplanned outages during implementation.  
- **Service Restart** → Required after configuration changes.  
- **Application Restart** → Needed for patching or upgrades.  
- **Legacy Applications** → May break if updates are applied without testing.  
- **Dependencies** → Ensure related services/systems are accounted for.  

---

## Documentation  

- **Updating Diagrams** → Network/system diagrams must reflect changes.  
- **Updating Policies/Procedures** → Ensure operational docs stay aligned.  

---

## Version Control  

- Tracks changes to code, configs, and documents.  
- Provides **rollback, auditing, and accountability**.  
- Examples: Git, SVN.

## Flashcards Q&A  

**Q: Why is change management important for security?**  
A: It ensures changes are controlled, documented, and tested to prevent outages or vulnerabilities.  

**Q: What’s an impact analysis?**  
A: Assessing risks and effects of a change on security, users, and business operations.  

**Q: What’s the purpose of a backout plan?**  
A: To safely revert if the change fails.  

**Q: Give an example of a business process that supports change management.**  
A: Approval process, stakeholder review, maintenance window.  

**Q: What’s a technical risk when changing allow lists/deny lists?**  
A: Blocking critical apps/services or unintentionally permitting insecure ones.  

**Q: Why use version control in change management?**  
A: To track modifications, provide rollback, and maintain accountability.
