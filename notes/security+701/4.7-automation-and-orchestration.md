# 4.7 â€“ Automation and Orchestration

### Use Cases of Automation & Scripting
- **User provisioning:** Automatically create accounts, assign roles, and apply policies.  
- **Resource provisioning:** Deploy servers/containers with secure configurations.  
- **Guard rails:** Enforce security rules (e.g., prevent public cloud storage buckets).  
- **Security groups:** Auto-apply firewall rules, ACLs, and access controls.  
- **Ticket creation & escalation:** Auto-generate tickets from alerts and route to correct teams.  
- **Enabling/disabling services and access:** Quickly disable compromised accounts or stop risky services.  
- **Continuous integration & testing:** Automate security testing in CI/CD (DevSecOps).  
- **Integrations and APIs:** Connect SIEM, SOAR, IAM, and cloud tools for streamlined response.  

### Benefits of Automation & Orchestration
- **Efficiency / Time saving:** Reduces repetitive manual work.  
- **Enforcing baselines:** Ensures security configs remain consistent.  
- **Standard infrastructure configurations:** IaC provides predictable, secure builds.  
- **Scaling in a secure manner:** Growth without introducing misconfigurations.  
- **Employee retention:** Reduces burnout from alert fatigue.  
- **Reaction time:** Faster response to threats/incidents.  
- **Workforce multiplier:** Smaller teams handle more with automation.  

### Other Considerations
- **Complexity:** More moving parts can increase risk.  
- **Cost:** High upfront investment in tools and training.  
- **Single point of failure (SPOF):** Central orchestration system could be a target or failure risk.  
- **Technical debt:** Poorly maintained scripts/workflows cause long-term issues.  
- **Ongoing supportability:** Automated workflows need updates as systems and threats evolve.

## Flashcards

**Q: What is user provisioning in automation?**  
A: Automatically creating accounts, assigning roles, and applying policies when a user joins.

**Q: What is resource provisioning?**  
A: Deploying servers or cloud resources with secure, standardized configurations.

**Q: What are guard rails in automation?**  
A: Built-in policies that prevent insecure actions (e.g., blocking public storage buckets).

**Q: How can automation help with ticketing?**  
A: Automatically generating and escalating tickets based on alerts.

**Q: Give an example of automation in access control.**  
A: Automatically disabling compromised accounts or shutting down services.

**Q: What role does automation play in CI/CD?**  
A: Security testing is integrated into pipelines (DevSecOps).

**Q: Why use APIs in automation and orchestration?**  
A: To connect and integrate tools like SIEM, SOAR, IAM, and cloud platforms.

**Q: What are key benefits of automation for SOC teams?**  
A: Efficiency, faster reaction time, workforce multiplier, reduced burnout.

**Q: How does automation enforce baselines?**  
A: By consistently applying security policies/configurations across systems.

**Q: Why does automation improve scaling?**  
A: Ensures secure expansion of infrastructure without gaps.

**Q: What is a workforce multiplier effect?**  
A: Small teams manage large environments through automation.

**Q: What is a risk of central orchestration systems?**  
A: They may become a single point of failure or attack target.

**Q: What is technical debt in automation?**  
A: Accumulated problems from poorly maintained or quick-fix scripts.

**Q: Why is supportability important in automation?**  
A: Automated workflows need regular updates to stay secure and functional.
