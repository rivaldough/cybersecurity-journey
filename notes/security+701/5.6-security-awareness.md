# 5.6 â€“ Security Awareness

### Phishing
- **Campaigns:** Simulated phishing emails to test employees.  
- **Recognizing attempts:** Look for suspicious links, urgency, poor grammar, mismatched domains.  
- **Responding:** Employees report suspicious messages to security team.  

### Anomalous Behavior Recognition
- **Risky:** Unsafe user actions (e.g., disabling antivirus).  
- **Unexpected:** Access attempts outside normal hours or locations.  
- **Unintentional:** Mistakes like misdirected emails or accidental data disclosure.  

### User Guidance and Training
- **Policy/handbooks:** Define expected behaviors.  
- **Situational awareness:** Encouraging employees to be vigilant.  
- **Insider threat:** Educating on signs of malicious or negligent insiders.  
- **Password management:** Strong, unique passwords; use of managers.  
- **Removable media & cables:** Risks of USBs, rogue devices.  
- **Social engineering:** Awareness of manipulation tactics.  
- **Operational security (OPSEC):** Protect sensitive processes and data.  
- **Hybrid/remote work:** Secure home networks, VPN, safe collaboration.  

### Reporting and Monitoring
- **Initial training:** Provided during onboarding.  
- **Recurring training:** Regular refreshers to reinforce best practices.  

### Development and Execution
- Build structured security awareness program.  
- Execute via campaigns, workshops, e-learning, and simulations.
