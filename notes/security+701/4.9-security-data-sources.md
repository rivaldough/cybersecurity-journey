# 4.9 – Security Data Sources

## Notes

### Log Data
- **Firewall logs**: Record allowed/blocked traffic, source/destination IPs, ports, protocols. Useful for tracking network access attempts.
- **Application logs**: Contain events/errors/warnings from apps (e.g., web servers, DBs). Useful for troubleshooting and detecting suspicious activity.
- **Endpoint logs**: Show activity on user devices (antivirus alerts, EDR telemetry, process execution, USB usage).
- **OS-specific security logs**:
  - Windows: Event Viewer (logon events, policy changes, process creation).
  - Linux: `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/syslog` for authentication and system events.
- **IPS/IDS logs**: Alerts and signatures of suspicious/malicious network activity.
- **Network logs**: Router/switch logs, flow data (NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX) showing communication patterns.
- **Metadata**: Contextual info such as timestamps, geolocation, file hashes, email headers — helps pivot and correlate.

### Other Data Sources
- **Vulnerability scans**: Identify weaknesses, missing patches, misconfigurations. Provide context for exploitability.
- **Automated reports**: Scheduled outputs from SIEMs, vulnerability management systems, or compliance tools.
- **Dashboards**: Visual summaries of log data, KPIs, trends — used for situational awareness.
- **Packet captures (pcaps)**: Full-fidelity network data. Deep dive into traffic payloads, protocol analysis, malware C2, or data exfiltration.

## Flashcards

**Q: What information do firewall logs provide?**  
A: Records of allowed/blocked traffic, including IPs, ports, and protocols.

**Q: Why are application logs important in investigations?**  
A: They show errors, warnings, and suspicious activity specific to applications.

**Q: Give examples of endpoint logs.**  
A: Antivirus alerts, EDR telemetry, process execution, and USB device usage.

**Q: What are OS-specific security logs in Windows?**  
A: Event Viewer logs (logon events, policy changes, process creation).

**Q: What are OS-specific security logs in Linux?**  
A: Files like `/var/log/auth.log` and `/var/log/syslog`.

**Q: What do IDS/IPS logs contain?**  
A: Alerts about suspicious or malicious network activity based on signatures/behavior.

**Q: What are network logs and flow data used for?**  
A: Tracking communication patterns between hosts (e.g., NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX).

**Q: What is metadata in the context of investigations?**  
A: Contextual info such as timestamps, geolocation, file hashes, or email headers.

**Q: What is the purpose of vulnerability scans as a data source?**  
A: To identify weaknesses, missing patches, and misconfigurations.

**Q: What are automated reports in security monitoring?**  
A: Scheduled outputs from SIEMs, vuln management, or compliance tools.

**Q: How are dashboards useful for investigations?**  
A: Provide visual summaries of logs, KPIs, and trends for situational awareness.

**Q: When would packet captures be used?**  
A: For deep forensic analysis of network traffic, including payloads and C2 activity.

**Q: What’s a drawback of relying solely on packet captures?**  
A: They’re large and resource-intensive; not practical for long-term storage.

**Q: Which log source best shows policy changes on a Windows system?**  
A: Windows Event Viewer security logs.

**Q: Which data source provides the highest level of detail about network packets?**  
A: Packet captures (pcaps).
