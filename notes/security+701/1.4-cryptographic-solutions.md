# 1.4 Cryptographic Solutions  

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)  
- **Public Key** → Shared openly, used for encryption or verifying digital signatures.  
- **Private Key** → Kept secret, used for decryption or creating digital signatures.  
- **Key Escrow** → Third party holds a copy of keys for recovery/compliance.

## Encryption  

### Levels of Encryption  
- **Full-disk** → Encrypts the entire disk (e.g., BitLocker).  
- **Partition** → Encrypts specific disk partitions.  
- **File** → Individual file encryption.  
- **Volume** → Virtual encrypted container (e.g., VeraCrypt volume).  
- **Database** → Encrypts entire databases.  
- **Record** → Encrypts individual database rows/records.  

### Transport / Communication  
- Protects data **in transit**. Examples: TLS, HTTPS, VPNs.  

### Symmetric vs Asymmetric  
- **Symmetric** → One shared key for encryption & decryption. Faster.  
- **Asymmetric** → Key pair (public/private). Used for key exchange, signing.  

### Key Exchange  
- Process of securely sharing keys.  
- Example: Diffie-Hellman.  

### Algorithms  
- **Symmetric:** AES, 3DES.  
- **Asymmetric:** RSA, ECC.  

### Key Length  
- Longer keys = stronger encryption, but slower performance.  
- Example: AES-256 is stronger than AES-128.

## Cryptographic Tools  

- **TPM (Trusted Platform Module):** Chip on motherboard storing keys securely.  
- **HSM (Hardware Security Module):** Dedicated hardware for secure key storage & crypto ops.  
- **Key Management System:** Software to handle key lifecycle.  
- **Secure Enclave:** Isolated hardware environment for sensitive operations (Apple Secure Enclave, Intel SGX).  

---

## Obfuscation  

- **Steganography:** Hiding data within other files (e.g., image, audio).  
- **Tokenization:** Replace sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens.  
- **Data Masking:** Hide or redact real data (e.g., credit card numbers in test environments).  

---

## Hashing  
- One-way function → maps input to fixed output.  
- Used for integrity checks, password storage.  

## Salting  
- Random data added before hashing → prevents rainbow table attacks.  

## Digital Signatures  
- Provide integrity + non-repudiation.  
- Private key signs, public key verifies.  

## Key Stretching  
- Strengthens weak passwords with algorithms like PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt.  

---

## Blockchain & Ledgers  

- **Blockchain:** Distributed ledger secured with cryptography.  
- **Open Public Ledger:** Transparent record accessible to anyone.  

---

## Certificates  

- **Certificate Authority (CA):** Trusted entity issuing certificates.  
- **Certificate Revocation List (CRL):** List of revoked/invalid certificates.  
- **OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol):** Real-time check of certificate validity.  
- **Self-signed:** Certificate signed by its own key.  
- **Third-party:** Issued by a trusted CA.  
- **Root of Trust:** Anchor of PKI trust chain (root CA).  
- **CSR (Certificate Signing Request):** Request sent to CA to issue a cert.  
- **Wildcard Certificate:** Covers multiple subdomains (`*.example.com`).

## Flashcards Q&A  

**Q: What’s the difference between a public key and private key?**  
A: Public = encrypt/verify, Private = decrypt/sign.  

**Q: What does full-disk encryption protect against?**  
A: Data exposure if the physical disk is stolen.  

**Q: Which is faster: symmetric or asymmetric encryption?**  
A: Symmetric is faster (but requires secure key exchange).  

**Q: What is the role of a TPM vs an HSM?**  
A: TPM = onboard chip for secure key storage; HSM = dedicated hardware device for secure crypto.  

**Q: How does salting improve password security?**  
A: Adds randomness before hashing → prevents rainbow table attacks.  

**Q: Which certificate validation method is real-time?**  
A: OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol).  

**Q: What’s the purpose of key stretching?**  
A: Make weak passwords harder to brute-force (e.g., bcrypt).  

**Q: What’s a wildcard certificate used for?**  
A: Securing multiple subdomains under one domain.
