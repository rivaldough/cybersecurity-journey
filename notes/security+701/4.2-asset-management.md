# 4.2 – Asset Management

## Overview
Asset management ensures that hardware, software, and data are properly controlled throughout their entire lifecycle (from acquisition to disposal). Poor management creates security blind spots, shadow IT, and higher risk of data loss or breaches.

---

## Acquisition / Procurement Process
- Security should be part of procurement decisions (vendor risk assessment, supply chain security).
- Verify compliance with organizational standards and regulations.
- Ensure licensing, patchability, and vendor support are included.
- Consider hardware/software lifecycle and end-of-support dates.

---

## Assignment / Accounting
### Ownership
- Every asset (hardware, software, data) should have a clearly assigned owner.
- Owners are accountable for updates, patches, and secure use.

### Classification
- Assets are categorized based on sensitivity and criticality (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted).
- Drives access control, encryption, and handling requirements.

---

## Monitoring / Asset Tracking
### Inventory
- Maintain a centralized inventory of all assets (hardware, software, virtual, cloud).
- Should include location, status, serial numbers, OS versions, etc.

### Enumeration
- Regularly scan networks and endpoints to detect new/unauthorized devices or software.
- Helps spot shadow IT and ensures inventory is accurate.

---

## Disposal / Decommissioning
### Sanitization
- Data is securely wiped so it cannot be recovered (overwriting, cryptographic erase).

### Destruction
- Physical destruction of drives/media (shredding, degaussing, incineration).

### Certification
- Third-party vendors often provide certificates of destruction to prove compliance.
- Auditable record of proper data disposal.

### Data Retention
- Policies define how long data must be kept (legal, business, or compliance reasons).
- Secure deletion must occur when retention period ends.

---

## Security Implications
- Weak asset management = unpatched systems, unknown software, forgotten data, or improper disposal → all major attack vectors.
- Proper asset management = visibility, accountability, compliance, and reduced risk of breaches.

# Flashcards (Q&A)

**Q: Why is asset management important for security?**  
A: It prevents blind spots, reduces attack surface, ensures accountability, and supports compliance.  

**Q: What should be included in the procurement process for secure assets?**  
A: Vendor risk assessments, lifecycle planning, licensing, patchability, and compliance checks.  

**Q: What does asset ownership mean?**  
A: Every asset has a designated person or department responsible for its security and maintenance.  

**Q: What is asset classification used for?**  
A: To categorize assets by sensitivity (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted) and define handling requirements.  

**Q: What is the purpose of asset inventory?**  
A: To maintain a complete record of all hardware, software, and data for tracking and accountability.  

**Q: What is asset enumeration?**  
A: Regular scanning to detect unauthorized or unknown devices/software.  

**Q: What is data sanitization?**  
A: Securely wiping data so it cannot be recovered.  

**Q: What is data destruction?**  
A: Physically rendering media unusable (shredding, incineration, degaussing).  

**Q: What is a certificate of destruction?**  
A: Proof from a vendor that data/media was properly destroyed, used for compliance and audits.  

**Q: What is data retention?**  
A: Policies defining how long data must be kept and ensuring secure deletion after the retention period.
