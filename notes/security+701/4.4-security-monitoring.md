# 4.4 – Security Monitoring

## Monitoring Computing Resources
- **Systems**: Workstations, servers, endpoints.
- **Applications**: Business apps, databases, cloud services.
- **Infrastructure**: Networks, firewalls, routers, switches.

---

## Activities
- **Log aggregation**
  - Collect logs from multiple sources into a central repository.
  - Enables correlation, easier analysis, and long-term storage.

- **Alerting**
  - Notify administrators of suspicious or abnormal activity.
  - Can be threshold-based (CPU usage) or behavior-based (malware indicators).

- **Scanning**
  - Regular vulnerability scans, compliance scans, or malware scans.
  - Identifies misconfigurations and weaknesses.

- **Reporting**
  - Summarizes findings for stakeholders.
  - Supports compliance and ongoing security improvements.

- **Archiving**
  - Long-term storage of logs and reports.
  - Critical for regulatory compliance, forensics, and historical analysis.

---

## Alert Response and Remediation / Validation
- **Quarantine**
  - Isolate compromised systems to prevent lateral spread.
- **Alert tuning**
  - Adjust alert thresholds/rules to reduce false positives and noise.
- **Validation**
  - Confirm alerts are legitimate and remediated properly.

---

## Tools
- **Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)**
  - Standard for automating vulnerability management and policy compliance.
- **Benchmarks**
  - Industry standards (e.g., CIS Benchmarks) for secure system configurations.
- **Agents / Agentless**
  - Agents: Installed on endpoints for detailed data collection.
  - Agentless: Uses remote queries (SNMP, WMI) for lighter monitoring.

- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**
  - Centralized log collection, correlation, analysis, and alerting.
  - Example: Splunk, ELK, QRadar.

- **Antivirus (AV)**
  - Detects and blocks known malware.
  - Now often integrated into endpoint detection and response (EDR).

- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**
  - Monitors and prevents unauthorized transfer of sensitive data.
  - Can be endpoint-based, network-based, or cloud-based.

- **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traps**
  - Device-generated alerts sent to management systems.
  - Monitors availability, performance, and faults.

- **NetFlow**
  - Collects metadata about network traffic flows.
  - Useful for detecting anomalies (e.g., unusual traffic volumes).

- **Vulnerability scanners**
  - Identify system/software weaknesses.
  - Example: Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys.

# Flashcards (Q&A)

**Q: What are the three main types of computing resources monitored in security?**  
A: Systems, applications, and infrastructure.  

**Q: What is log aggregation used for?**  
A: To collect and centralize logs for correlation, analysis, and storage.  

**Q: What is the purpose of alerting in security monitoring?**  
A: To notify admins of suspicious or abnormal activity.  

**Q: What does scanning in monitoring involve?**  
A: Running vulnerability, compliance, or malware scans to find weaknesses.  

**Q: Why is reporting important in monitoring?**  
A: It summarizes findings for stakeholders and compliance.  

**Q: What is the purpose of archiving logs?**  
A: To store logs long-term for compliance, forensics, and historical analysis.  

**Q: What is quarantine in alert response?**  
A: Isolating a compromised system to stop lateral spread.  

**Q: What is alert tuning?**  
A: Adjusting thresholds or rules to reduce false positives/noise.  

**Q: What does validation mean in alert response?**  
A: Confirming alerts are real and properly remediated.  

**Q: What is SCAP?**  
A: Security Content Automation Protocol — a standard for automated vulnerability management and compliance.  

**Q: What are benchmarks in security monitoring?**  
A: Industry standards for secure configurations (e.g., CIS Benchmarks).  

**Q: What is the difference between agent and agentless monitoring?**  
A: Agents are installed on endpoints for detailed data; agentless uses remote queries for lighter monitoring.  

**Q: What is a SIEM used for?**  
A: Central log collection, correlation, and analysis with alerting.  

**Q: Give an example of a SIEM tool.**  
A: Splunk, ELK, or QRadar.  

**Q: What does antivirus software do in monitoring?**  
A: Detects and blocks malware, often as part of EDR.  

**Q: What does DLP stand for and what does it do?**  
A: Data Loss Prevention — stops unauthorized transfer of sensitive data.  

**Q: What are SNMP traps used for?**  
A: Device-generated alerts for availability, performance, and faults.  

**Q: What is NetFlow and what does it monitor?**  
A: Metadata about traffic flows; used to detect anomalies.  

**Q: What do vulnerability scanners do?**  
A: Identify system/software weaknesses (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys).
