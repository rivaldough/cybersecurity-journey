# 2.2 Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces  

## Message-Based Vectors  
- **Email** → Phishing, malicious attachments, links.  
- **SMS (Smishing)** → Malicious links or fake alerts via text.  
- **Instant Messaging (IM)** → Social engineering, malware links in chat apps.  

---

## Image-Based Vectors  
- Malicious code hidden in images (steganography).  
- Used in phishing emails or downloads.  

---

## File-Based Vectors  
- Infected documents, PDFs, or executables.  
- Common with drive-by downloads or malicious attachments.  

---

## Voice Call Vectors  
- **Vishing** (voice phishing) → Social engineering over phone calls.  
- Fake tech support, bank calls, or robocalls.  

---

## Removable Devices  
- Malware-loaded USBs or external drives.  
- Often used for insider or physical access attacks.  

---

## Vulnerable Software  
- **Client-based:** Requires agent/installation (e.g., vulnerable apps, plugins).  
- **Agentless:** Runs in browser or web interface, still vulnerable.  

---

## Unsupported Systems & Applications  
- End-of-life software without security patches.  
- High risk for exploitation.  

---

## Unsecure Networks  
- **Wireless:** Rogue APs, weak Wi-Fi encryption (WEP/WPA).  
- **Wired:** Open ports, unmonitored access points.  
- **Bluetooth:** Bluejacking, Bluesnarfing, device hijacking.  

---

## Open Service Ports  
- Unnecessary or misconfigured open ports expose services to attack.  
- Example: Open RDP (3389), Telnet, FTP.  

---

## Default Credentials  
- Devices/apps shipped with default logins (e.g., “admin/admin”).  
- Attackers scan for and exploit these.  

---

## Supply Chain Attacks  
- **MSPs (Managed Service Providers):** Compromise provider → gain access to clients.  
- **Vendors/Suppliers:** Insert malware/weaknesses in software or hardware.  
- Example: SolarWinds breach.  

---

## Human Vectors / Social Engineering  

- **Phishing** → Fraudulent emails to steal data/credentials.  
- **Vishing** → Phone-based phishing.  
- **Smishing** → SMS/text-based phishing.  
- **Misinformation/Disinformation** → Manipulating people with false info.  
- **Impersonation** → Pretending to be someone with authority.  
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** CEO/CFO fraud — fake wire transfer requests.  
- **Pretexting** → Fabricated scenario to trick someone into giving info.  
- **Watering Hole** → Compromise site commonly visited by the target group.  
- **Brand Impersonation** → Fake domains/websites that mimic real ones.  
- **Typosquatting** → Registering misspelled domains (e.g., goggle.com).

## Flashcards Q&A  

**Q: What’s the difference between phishing, smishing, and vishing?**  
A: Phishing = email, Smishing = SMS/text, Vishing = voice/phone.  

**Q: What’s a watering hole attack?**  
A: Compromising a website commonly visited by a target group to infect them.  

**Q: Why are default credentials dangerous?**  
A: Attackers can scan and log in easily if not changed.  

**Q: Give two examples of unsecure networks.**  
A: Open Wi-Fi, misconfigured Bluetooth, unmonitored wired ports.  

**Q: How do supply chain attacks work?**  
A: Compromise a trusted provider/vendor → attack spreads downstream to customers.  

**Q: What is typosquatting?**  
A: Registering misspelled domains to trick users (e.g., amaz0n.com).  

**Q: Which attack type is Business Email Compromise (BEC)?**  
A: Social engineering — impersonating executives to trick users into financial actions.
