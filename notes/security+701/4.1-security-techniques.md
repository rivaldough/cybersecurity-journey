# 4.1 – Security Techniques

## Secure Baselines
- **Establish**: Create a known-good, securely configured system state.
- **Deploy**: Apply the baseline to all relevant systems.
- **Maintain**: Continuously patch, update, and audit to ensure compliance.

## Hardening Targets
- **Mobile devices**: Screen locks, encryption, app whitelisting, remote wipe.
- **Workstations**: Remove unnecessary software, least privilege, patch management.
- **Switches**: Disable unused ports, enable port security, management plane protection.
- **Routers**: Change default creds, ACLs, secure routing protocols, disable unused services.
- **Cloud infrastructure**: IAM controls, network segmentation, secure APIs, monitoring.
- **Servers**: Patch OS/apps, disable unneeded services, enable host firewalls, log monitoring.
- **ICS/SCADA**: Network isolation, patch when possible, strong access controls, monitor for anomalies.
- **Embedded systems**: Patch firmware, disable unnecessary services, control physical access.
- **RTOS (Real-Time OS)**: Minimize attack surface, strict access control, secure updates.
- **IoT devices**: Change default creds, isolate network, keep firmware up-to-date.

## Wireless Devices
### Installation considerations
- **Site surveys**: Assess wireless coverage, interference, and placement needs.
- **Heat maps**: Visualize Wi-Fi signal strength to optimize AP placement and reduce dead zones.

## Mobile Solutions
- **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**: Centralized control — enforce security policies, push updates, remote wipe, containerization.
- **Deployment models**:
  - **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)**: User-owned, flexible but higher risk.
  - **COPE (Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled)**: Company-owned, controlled but allows personal use.
  - **CYOD (Choose Your Own Device)**: Users pick from a company-approved list.
- **Connection methods**:
  - **Cellular**: 4G/5G, wide coverage, provider-secured.
  - **Wi-Fi**: Common, must be encrypted and secured.
  - **Bluetooth**: Short-range, secure pairing required.

## Wireless Security Settings
- **WPA3**: Strongest Wi-Fi encryption standard (SAE replaces WPA2’s PSK).
- **AAA / RADIUS**: Centralized authentication, authorization, accounting.
- **Cryptographic protocols**: TLS, IPsec for data-in-transit protection.
- **Authentication protocols**: EAP, PEAP, EAP-TLS, etc., for secure identity verification.

## Application Security
- **Input validation**: Prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS).
- **Secure cookies**: Use flags (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`) to protect session tokens.
- **Static code analysis**: Automated review of source code for vulnerabilities before execution.
- **Code signing**: Validate integrity/authenticity of code using digital certificates.

## Sandboxing
- Isolating apps or processes to prevent malicious code from impacting the host system.
- Common in mobile apps, browsers, and malware analysis.

## Monitoring
- Continuous observation of systems and networks.
- Detects anomalies, intrusions, and policy violations.
- Supports incident response and compliance.

# Flashcards (Q&A)

**Q: What are the three phases of a secure baseline?**  
A: Establish, Deploy, Maintain.  

**Q: Why are secure baselines important?**  
A: They ensure all systems start from a known, hardened state and remain consistent over time.  

**Q: How do you harden mobile devices?**  
A: Screen locks, encryption, app whitelisting, and remote wipe.  

**Q: How do you harden workstations?**  
A: Remove unnecessary software, enforce least privilege, and patch regularly.  

**Q: How do you harden switches?**  
A: Disable unused ports, enable port security, and secure the management plane.  

**Q: How do you harden routers?**  
A: Change default creds, configure ACLs, secure routing protocols, and disable unused services.  

**Q: What’s unique about hardening ICS/SCADA?**  
A: Focus on network isolation, strict access control, and anomaly monitoring since patching may be limited.  

**Q: How do you secure IoT devices?**  
A: Change default credentials, isolate them on a separate network, and update firmware.  

**Q: What are site surveys used for in wireless deployment?**  
A: To assess coverage, interference, and optimal placement of APs.  

**Q: What is a heat map in wireless security?**  
A: A visual map of Wi-Fi signal strength used to optimize AP placement and detect dead zones.  

**Q: What is MDM and why is it important?**  
A: Mobile Device Management; enforces centralized security policies on mobile endpoints.  

**Q: What are the three main mobile deployment models?**  
A: BYOD, COPE, CYOD.  

**Q: What’s the difference between BYOD and COPE?**  
A: BYOD = user-owned, less control; COPE = company-owned but allows personal use, more control.  

**Q: What is WPA3?**  
A: The latest Wi-Fi security standard using SAE for stronger encryption.  

**Q: What role does RADIUS play in wireless security?**  
A: Provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting.  

**Q: Give an example of a cryptographic protocol for data-in-transit.**  
A: TLS or IPsec.  

**Q: Give an example of an authentication protocol.**  
A: EAP, PEAP, or EAP-TLS.  

**Q: What is input validation in application security?**  
A: Ensuring only properly formatted data is accepted to prevent injection attacks.  

**Q: What flags make cookies more secure?**  
A: Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite.  

**Q: What is static code analysis?**  
A: Automated scanning of source code to detect vulnerabilities before execution.  

**Q: What is code signing used for?**  
A: To prove authenticity and integrity of software using digital certificates.  

**Q: What is sandboxing?**  
A: Isolating apps or code to prevent malicious activity from spreading to the host system.  

**Q: Why is monitoring important in security architecture?**  
A: It detects anomalies, intrusions, and supports incident response.
