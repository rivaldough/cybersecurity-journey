# 2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity  

## Malware Attacks  

- **Ransomware** → Encrypts files, demands payment for decryption key.  
- **Trojan** → Malicious program disguised as legitimate software.  
- **Worm** → Self-replicates and spreads across networks.  
- **Spyware** → Secretly monitors user activity (keystrokes, browsing).  
- **Bloatware** → Unwanted pre-installed or bundled software, can be exploited.  
- **Virus** → Malicious code that attaches to a host file, spreads when executed.  
- **Keylogger** → Records keystrokes to steal credentials.  
- **Logic Bomb** → Malicious code triggered by an event or condition (e.g., date/time).  
- **Rootkit** → Hides attacker presence, gives deep system-level access.

## Physical Attacks  

- **Brute Force (Physical)** → Repeated attempts to bypass physical security (e.g., door PINs).  
- **RFID Cloning** → Copying RFID badge/card data for unauthorized access.  
- **Environmental** → Tampering with power, HVAC, or physical systems to disrupt operations.

## Network Attacks  

- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):** Overwhelm target with traffic.  
  - **Amplified:** Attack traffic volume is increased (e.g., DNS amplification).  
  - **Reflected:** Attack traffic bounces off third parties to hide source.  
- **DNS Attacks:** Cache poisoning, hijacking, tunneling.  
- **Wireless Attacks:** Rogue AP, Evil Twin, deauthentication attacks.  
- **On-Path (Man-in-the-Middle):** Intercept and alter communications.  
- **Credential Replay:** Captured credentials reused to gain access.  
- **Malicious Code Injection:** Planting unauthorized scripts or code into systems.  

---

## Application Attacks  

- **Injection Attacks:** SQL injection, command injection.  
- **Buffer Overflow:** Overwrite memory to crash or run malicious code.  
- **Replay Attack:** Reuse of intercepted communications or credentials.  
- **Privilege Escalation:** Exploiting flaws to gain higher privileges.  
- **Forgery:** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), forging requests as a trusted user.  
- **Directory Traversal:** Accessing files outside authorized directories (`../etc/passwd`).  

---

## Cryptographic Attacks  

- **Downgrade Attack:** Force weaker encryption standards (e.g., SSL → HTTP).  
- **Collision Attack:** Two inputs producing the same hash value.  
- **Birthday Attack:** Probability-based attack exploiting hash collisions.  

---

## Password Attacks  

- **Password Spraying:** Try one common password across many accounts.  
- **Brute Force (Digital):** Systematic attempt of all possible passwords.  

---

## Indicators of Malicious Activity  

- **Account Lockout:** Too many failed login attempts.  
- **Concurrent Session Usage:** Same credentials active in multiple locations.  
- **Blocked Content:** Security tools block traffic or files.  
- **Impossible Travel:** Logins from geographically impossible locations in short time.  
- **Resource Consumption:** CPU/memory/network overload.  
- **Resource Inaccessibility:** Users can’t reach expected resources.  
- **Out-of-Cycle Logging:** Unexpected logs/events outside normal hours.  
- **Published/Documented Indicators:** Known IOCs (e.g., IPs, hashes, domains from threat intel feeds).  
- **Missing Logs:** Gaps in logging activity, possibly from tampering.

## Flashcards Q&A  

**Q: What’s the difference between a worm and a virus?**  
A: Worm self-replicates without user action; a virus requires user execution of a host file.  

**Q: What is a logic bomb?**  
A: Malicious code triggered by a specific event (e.g., a date).  

**Q: Which physical attack involves copying badge data?**  
A: RFID cloning.  

**Q: What’s the difference between an amplified and reflected DDoS?**  
A: Amplified = increases attack traffic volume, Reflected = bounces traffic off third parties to hide the attacker.  

**Q: Which attack exploits trust in DNS?**  
A: DNS poisoning/hijacking.  

**Q: What’s privilege escalation?**  
A: Exploiting a flaw to gain higher permissions than intended.  

**Q: What’s a collision attack in cryptography?**  
A: When two different inputs produce the same hash output.  

**Q: How does password spraying differ from brute force?**  
A: Spraying = one password tried across many accounts; Brute force = many passwords tried against one account.  

**Q: What’s an “impossible travel” indicator?**  
A: Login attempts from geographically distant places in an unrealistic timeframe.  

**Q: Why are missing logs an indicator of compromise?**  
A: Attackers may delete/alter logs to cover their tracks.
