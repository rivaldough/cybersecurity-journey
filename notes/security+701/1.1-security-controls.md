- Examples: Warning banners, security cameras (visible), signs.  

### Detective  
- Aim: **Identify and alert when something happens.**  
- Examples: IDS, logs, security alarms, CCTV monitoring.  

### Corrective  
- Aim: **Fix issues after they occur.**  
- Examples: Patching, backups, reimaging systems.  

### Compensating  
- Aim: **Alternative control when the primary can’t be used.**  
- Example: Using 2FA when strong biometrics aren’t available.  

### Directive  
- Aim: **Prescribe rules or behaviors.**  
- Examples: Acceptable use policies (AUPs), signage, onboarding security briefings.
