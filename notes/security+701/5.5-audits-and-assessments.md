- **Examinations:** Formal reviews of systems/processes.  
- **Assessments:** Evaluate controls, vulnerabilities, and risks.  
- **Independent third-party audits:** Provide unbiased view of compliance.  

### Penetration Testing
- Simulated attacks to test defenses.  
- **Physical:** Test facility access controls.  
- **Offensive:** Ethical hacking to exploit vulnerabilities.  
- **Defensive:** Blue team activities monitoring and detecting attacks.  
- **Integrated (Red vs Blue / Purple teaming):** Combined offensive + defensive exercises.  
- **Known environment:** Testers have insider knowledge (white-box).  
- **Partially known environment:** Some details provided (gray-box).
