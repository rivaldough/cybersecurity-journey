# 2.1 Threat Actors  

## Common Threat Actors  

### Nation-State  
- State-sponsored groups, often military or intelligence-backed.  
- High funding, advanced tools, long-term operations (APT = Advanced Persistent Threat).  
- Motivations: Espionage, cyber warfare, disruption of critical infrastructure.  

### Unskilled Attacker ("Script Kiddie")  
- Low skill, relies on pre-made tools/exploits.  
- Limited resources.  
- Motivations: Fun, curiosity, bragging rights.  

### Hacktivist  
- Politically/ideologically motivated.  
- Targets orgs/governments to promote a cause.  
- Examples: DDoS, website defacement, leaks.  

### Insider Threat  
- Current or former employee/contractor with internal access.  
- May be malicious (revenge, theft) or unintentional (negligence).  
- Difficult to detect since they often have legitimate credentials.  

### Organized Crime  
- Professional criminal groups.  
- Well-funded, often operate like businesses.  
- Motivations: Financial gain via ransomware, fraud, identity theft.  

### Shadow IT  
- Unapproved devices, apps, or services set up without IT’s knowledge.  
- Risk: Lack of oversight → security gaps and compliance issues.

## Attributes of Threat Actors  

- **Internal vs External** → Internal (insiders, shadow IT), External (nation-state, organized crime, hacktivists).  
- **Resources/Funding** → Determines capability (script kiddie vs nation-state).  
- **Level of Sophistication** → Tools, techniques, persistence, stealth.

## Motivations  

- **Data Exfiltration** → Stealing sensitive information (intellectual property, PII).  
- **Espionage** → Spying for nation-states or competitors.  
- **Service Disruption** → DDoS, ransomware, sabotage.  
- **Blackmail/Extortion** → Ransomware, threats to release data.  
- **Financial Gain** → Fraud, theft, selling stolen data.

## Flashcards Q&A  

**Q: What’s the difference between a script kiddie and a nation-state actor?**  
A: Script kiddie = low skill, no funding, uses public tools. Nation-state = highly skilled, heavily funded, advanced campaigns.  

**Q: Which threat actor is most likely to deface a website for political reasons?**  
A: Hacktivist.  

**Q: Why are insider threats dangerous?**  
A: They already have legitimate access/credentials, making them harder to detect.  

**Q: What motivates organized crime groups?**  
A: Financial gain (ransomware, fraud, identity theft).  

**Q: What is Shadow IT and why is it risky?**  
A: Unauthorized IT resources (apps, services, devices) → create security blind spots.  

**Q: Give two common motivations of nation-state actors.**  
A: Espionage, disruption of critical infrastructure, or cyber warfare.  

**Q: Which motivation aligns with ethical hackers?**  
A: Ethical responsibility — reporting vulnerabilities instead of exploiting them.
