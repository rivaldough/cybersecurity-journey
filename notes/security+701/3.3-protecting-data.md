# **3.3 - Protecting Data**  

**Objective:** Compare and contrast concepts and strategies to protect data.  

---

## Data Types  

- **Regulated:** Covered by laws/regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS).  
- **Trade Secret:** Proprietary business knowledge, formulas, processes.  
- **Intellectual Property (IP):** Patents, trademarks, copyrights.  
- **Legal Information:** Contracts, case files, evidence.  
- **Financial Information:** Banking, credit card numbers, payroll.  
- **Human-readable vs Non-human-readable:**  
  - Human-readable: text, documents, emails.  
  - Non-human-readable: machine code, compiled binaries, metadata.  

---

## Data Classifications  

- **Sensitive:** Could cause harm if exposed (often umbrella term).  
- **Confidential:** Limited to specific groups; internal company data.  
- **Public:** Safe for anyone to access.  
- **Restricted:** Strict access, high potential impact if exposed.  
- **Private:** Personally identifiable information (PII).  
- **Critical:** Data essential to operations (loss = major outage).  

---

## General Data Considerations  

- **Data States:**  
  - **At Rest:** Stored data (disks, backups). Protect with encryption.  
  - **In Transit:** Moving data (network traffic). Protect with TLS/IPSec.  
  - **In Use:** Data actively processed in memory/CPU. Harder to protect (secure enclaves, DRM).  

- **Data Sovereignty:** Data must follow laws of the country where it’s stored.  
- **Geolocation:** Location of data centers can affect compliance, latency, and access.  

---

## Methods to Secure Data  

- **Geographic Restrictions:** Limit access based on IP location or region.  
- **Encryption:** Protect confidentiality of data at rest, in transit, or in use.  
- **Hashing:** Ensure integrity; detect changes in files or passwords.  
- **Masking:** Hide parts of sensitive data (e.g., show last 4 digits of credit card).  
- **Tokenization:** Replace sensitive data with non-sensitive placeholder (token).  
- **Obfuscation:** Make code/data harder to understand (used in software protection).  
- **Segmentation:** Separate systems/networks to reduce risk and contain exposure.  
- **Permission Restrictions:** Use least privilege; enforce access control lists (ACLs) and role-based access control (RBAC).

# Flashcards Q&A  

**Q: What is regulated data?**  
A: Data covered by laws/regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS).  

**Q: Difference between trade secret and intellectual property?**  
A: Trade secret = confidential business knowledge (formulas, processes). IP = legally protected rights (patents, trademarks, copyrights).  

**Q: Examples of financial data?**  
A: Credit card numbers, bank accounts, payroll.  

**Q: Human-readable vs non-human-readable data?**  
A: Human-readable = text/docs. Non-human-readable = machine code, binaries, metadata.  

**Q: Name the 6 common data classifications.**  
A: Sensitive, Confidential, Public, Restricted, Private, Critical.  

**Q: What are the 3 states of data?**  
A: At rest, In transit, In use.  

**Q: What is data sovereignty?**  
A: Data must follow the laws of the country it’s stored in.  

**Q: What is geolocation in data protection?**  
A: Considering physical location of data centers for compliance and performance.  

**Q: What is the difference between masking and tokenization?**  
A: Masking hides parts of data (e.g., show last 4 digits). Tokenization replaces data entirely with a non-sensitive token.  

**Q: What is obfuscation used for?**  
A: Making code/data harder to read or reverse-engineer.  

**Q: What does segmentation achieve?**  
A: Separates networks/systems to limit scope of exposure and attacks.  

**Q: What principle underlies permission restrictions?**  
A: Least privilege — users only get access to what they need.
