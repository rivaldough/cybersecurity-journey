# 5.1 â€“ Security Governance

### Guidelines
- High-level recommendations or best practices.
- Provide direction but are not mandatory.
- Flexible and adaptive to changing needs.

### Policies
- Formal, mandatory rules that guide decision-making.
- Examples:
  - **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):** Defines how employees may use company assets.
  - **Information Security Policies:** Establish baseline security requirements.
  - **Business Continuity Policy:** Ensures operations continue during disruptions.
  - **Disaster Recovery Policy:** Details system/data recovery steps after major events.
  - **Incident Response Policy:** Defines process for handling security incidents.
  - **SDLC Policy:** Secure coding, testing, and release standards.
  - **Change Management Policy:** Governs how changes are requested, approved, and implemented.

### Standards
- Specific, measurable rules that support policies.
- Examples:
  - **Password standards:** Complexity, length, expiration.
  - **Access control standards:** Role-based, least privilege.
  - **Physical security standards:** Locks, surveillance, access cards.
  - **Encryption standards:** Protocols (TLS), key lengths, algorithms.

### Procedures
- Step-by-step instructions for carrying out tasks.
- Ensure consistency and compliance with policies.
- Examples:
  - **Change management procedures:** Submitting/approving changes.
  - **Onboarding/offboarding procedures:** Account creation, removal, permissions.
  - **Playbooks:** Prescribed responses to specific incidents (e.g., phishing).

### External Considerations
- **Regulatory:** HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS.
- **Legal:** Compliance with laws, contracts, liability.
- **Industry:** Sector-specific requirements (e.g., NERC CIP for energy).
- **Local/Regional:** City/province/state data/privacy rules.
- **National:** Federal mandates (FISMA, NIST).
- **Global:** International frameworks (ISO 27001, GDPR).

### Monitoring and Revision
- Governance must be living and adaptive.
- Regular audits, assessments, and updates.
- Aligns governance with evolving threats, technology, and regulations.

### Types of Governance Structures
- **Boards:** Corporate boards set strategic direction.
- **Committees:** Subgroups that oversee risk/security.
- **Government entities:** Enforce compliance and regulations.
- **Centralized:** Single entity makes governance decisions.
- **Decentralized:** Multiple entities share governance responsibility.

### Roles and Responsibilities for Systems and Data
- **Owners:** Senior-level, accountable for data/system security.
- **Controllers:** Decide how and why data is processed (GDPR context).
- **Processors:** Handle data on behalf of controllers.
- **Custodians/Stewards:** Operational staff maintaining and protecting systems/data.
