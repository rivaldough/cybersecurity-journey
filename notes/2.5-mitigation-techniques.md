# 2.5 Mitigation Techniques  

## Segmentation  
- Divide networks into zones (e.g., VLANs, DMZ).  
- Limits attacker lateral movement and contains breaches.  

---

## Access Control  
- **Access Control List (ACL):** Rules controlling traffic based on IP, port, protocol.  
- **Permissions:** Define what users/groups can access (files, apps, systems).  

---

## Application Allow List  
- Only approved applications can run.  
- Prevents execution of unauthorized/malicious software.  

---

## Isolation  
- Keep risky systems/services separate.  
- Examples: Sandboxing apps, quarantining infected hosts.  

---

## Patching  
- Apply vendor updates to fix vulnerabilities.  
- Critical to reduce exposure to known exploits.  

---

## Encryption  
- Protect data **at rest and in transit**.  
- Ensures confidentiality and integrity even if data is intercepted.  

---

## Monitoring  
- Continuous observation of logs, traffic, and system events.  
- Tools: SIEM, IDS/IPS, endpoint monitoring.  

---

## Least Privilege  
- Users/processes get **only the access needed** to do their job.  
- Reduces damage if credentials are compromised.  

---

## Configuration Enforcement  
- Ensure systems follow approved baseline configurations.  
- Prevents drift (unapproved/unintended changes).  
- Often automated via GPO, config management tools.  

---

## Decommissioning  
- Securely retire old systems.  
- Wipe/destroy drives, revoke credentials, update documentation.  

---

## Hardening Techniques  

- **Encryption:** Enable full-disk, database, and comms encryption.  
- **Endpoint Protection:** Install antivirus/EDR solutions.  
- **Host-based Firewall:** Restrict inbound/outbound traffic on the host.  
- **HIPS (Host Intrusion Prevention System):** Blocks suspicious host-level activity.  
- **Disable Unused Ports/Protocols:** Reduce attack surface (e.g., disable Telnet, FTP).  
- **Default Password Changes:** Replace vendor-supplied credentials.  
- **Remove Unnecessary Software:** Uninstall bloatware to reduce vulnerabilities.

## Flashcards Q&A  

**Q: What’s the purpose of segmentation?**  
A: To limit lateral movement and contain breaches.  

**Q: What’s the difference between ACLs and permissions?**  
A: ACLs = traffic filtering rules; Permissions = user/system access rights.  

**Q: Why use an application allow list?**  
A: Prevents unauthorized apps (and malware) from running.  

**Q: What’s the purpose of isolation in mitigation?**  
A: To contain threats by sandboxing apps or quarantining infected systems.  

**Q: Why is patching important?**  
A: Fixes known vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.  

**Q: What is configuration enforcement?**  
A: Ensures systems follow baseline configs, preventing insecure drift.  

**Q: Give two examples of system hardening.**  
A: Disable unused ports/protocols, change default passwords, remove unnecessary software.
