# 2.3 Types of Vulnerabilities  

## Application Vulnerabilities  
- **Memory Injection** → Injecting code into process memory to hijack execution.  
- **Buffer Overflow** → Writing more data than allocated, leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.  
- **Race Conditions** → Flaw where two operations happen out of order.  
  - **TOC (Time-of-Check):** Condition is checked, but changes before execution.  
  - **TOU (Time-of-Use):** Code executes based on outdated assumptions.  
- **Malicious Update** → Attackers modify software updates to deliver malware.

## Operating System (OS) Vulnerabilities  
- Misconfigurations, unpatched systems, privilege escalation.  
- Common target due to widespread use.  

---

## Web-Based Vulnerabilities  
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Malicious SQL queries inserted into input fields.  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by others.  

---

## Hardware Vulnerabilities  
- **Firmware Exploits:** Modify device firmware to gain persistence.  
- **End-of-Life (EOL):** No longer supported with patches.  
- **Legacy Hardware:** Old devices not designed with modern security in mind.  

---

## Virtualization Vulnerabilities  
- **VM Escape:** Malicious VM breaks out to control host or other VMs.  
- **Resource Reuse:** Residual data remains accessible after resource reallocation.  

---

## Cloud-Specific Vulnerabilities  
- Misconfigured storage buckets, exposed APIs, shared resource risks.  
- Often tied to improper cloud security configurations.  

---

## Supply Chain Vulnerabilities  
- **Service Provider:** Compromise managed services (MSPs).  
- **Hardware Provider:** Tampered or counterfeit components.  
- **Software Provider:** Compromised updates or dependencies.  

---

## Cryptographic Vulnerabilities  
- Weak algorithms, short key lengths, poor implementation.  
- Example: Using MD5 or DES in modern systems.  

---

## Misconfiguration  
- Improper settings creating exposure.  
- Example: Open S3 buckets, unnecessary open ports.  

---

## Mobile Device Vulnerabilities  
- **Sideloading:** Installing apps from untrusted sources.  
- **Jailbreaking:** Removing manufacturer restrictions → exposes device to threats.  

---

## Zero-Day Vulnerabilities  
- Newly discovered flaws not yet patched.  
- Highly valuable to attackers before vendor releases a fix.

## Flashcards Q&A  

**Q: What’s the difference between a buffer overflow and memory injection?**  
A: Buffer overflow = write too much data → crash/exploit. Memory injection = insert malicious code directly into process memory.  

**Q: Which vulnerability exploits the gap between validation and execution?**  
A: Race condition (TOC/TOU).  

**Q: What’s an example of a malicious update?**  
A: Attackers compromise a vendor’s update server to distribute malware.  

**Q: Give two common web-based vulnerabilities.**  
A: SQL injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  

**Q: What is VM escape?**  
A: When a virtual machine breaks out to interact with the host or other VMs.  

**Q: What’s the difference between end-of-life and legacy hardware?**  
A: EOL = no more vendor support/patches. Legacy = old design, lacks modern protections.  

**Q: What’s a zero-day vulnerability?**  
A: An unknown flaw with no available patch, actively exploited before disclosure.
