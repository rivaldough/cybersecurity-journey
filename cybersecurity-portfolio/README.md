## 👋 About Me  

Cloud-security learner based in **Toronto, Canada**, transitioning from a professional culinary background into the **cybersecurity and cloud infrastructure** space.  
Currently studying for **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** and **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**, while developing hands-on skills through labs, scripting, and cloud configurations.  

I’m passionate about **defensive security**, **identity management**, and **secure cloud design** — with a focus on applying practical, real-world techniques that bridge traditional IT and modern cloud environments.
